XSS --> cross site scripting

lab01

><img src=x onload=alert(1)>    or  <somename   ---> this is used to conform there is a vernalability in the code.(here when the secound one is used you have to check in the inspection ctrl+U to see the saved search when the search item is like '<somename' then it is conformed that it is vernalable)

then to reflect xss into html we use 

<svg src=x onload=alert(14)>   or <svg/ onload=alert(14)// 

you can use any of these.

----------

next is the reflected XSS into HTML context with most tags and attributes blocked:

try with some tags when not happing, go to the cross site scripting cheat sheet and copy all tags .
then open brup suite and intersept the connection and sent it to intruder , paste the tags there select only the place where tag has to be replaced and start the process of verifining what tags are allowed.

same goes for the events also.

<iframe src= "https://0a2b00c7041c87068096212d000f0024.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cbody%2F+onresize%3Dalert(45)%2F%2F" onload=this.style.width="500px"><iframe>     

this above code has to be saved and then used on the victium to exploit him here it is saved in roxci.html file.

this above code has to be submitted in the exploit server provided.
