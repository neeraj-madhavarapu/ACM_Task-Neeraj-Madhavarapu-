# Cross site scripting

I have learned about checking the vernalability of a search function, gained lot of knowledge about the tags and events in html.
Improved my use of brup suite to intercept the website and use it to perform the attacks safely.

here is the description of my work, [Cross-site Scripting](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/ACM_Task-Neeraj-Madhavarapu-/blob/main/Basic_web_security%20/Cross-site%20scripting/XSS_docx.txt).
Also enjoyed doing these, felt amazing!!!!
