# code decrypting 
I first learned what is  RSA Broadcast Attack scenario so it is possible to recover the original message by applying HÃ¥stad's Broadcast Attack.<br>
 Chinese Remainder Theorem is used where same plaintext encrypted under different moduli using the same small exponent.<br>
 So I found a code and tryed runnig it and volla!!!  it worked !!
 the gotten output was <br>
 
}d00g_0t_si_d4s4H{rcer

this above was in CTF fromate where we have to reverse the obtained code, So final code is,<br>

recr{H4s4d_is_t0_gooD}   which corresponds to  rec{Hashed_is_too_good}
