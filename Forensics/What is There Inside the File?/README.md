# CRACK FILE

Here i was unable to crack the .zip file using script as , the program run for 3 hours but no result.<br>
I also used some wordlists like rockyou.txt but the output is like no  passkey found in the wordlist.<br>\
So, i used the john the ripper tool in kali to crack open the .zip file.<br>
first i converted the .zip file into .txt file and then used john to crack the password.

It was quite fun in doing this exercise...
